# Persistence of numbers
I saw that nice video by Numberphile about the persistence of numbers; you know, when you multiply the digits of a number,
and since we want a lot of steps to get to 0, you have to never met a zero in the decomposition.
I know my explanations are a bit blurry, so just go run the program already.
I made two versions of the program.
